# **Solving Partial Differential Equations using Neural Operators**
Neural Operators are a relatively new method of approximating the solution of complex PDEs which occur in physics. This project is meant to be an implementation of a few of these methods to discern how exactly they work.

The neural operator architectures encountered and dealt with are: 
1. Deep Operator Networks
2. Fourier Neural Operators
3. Geometrically Aware Neural Operators
4. General Adversarial Neural Operators
etc.
